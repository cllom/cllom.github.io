									Becoming a teacher was my official full time job right after I graducated in Germany as a Mechtronics System Engineer. 
									I am pretty happy about it because somehow after several experiences helping my fellow junior students or friends 
									finishing their works in a class as a student assistant give me a sense of satisfiction. In fact, fablab communities 
									always give me motivation to build something, the things that I have always doing. Now I could meet the same passionate 
									people. So I arrived to Shanghai and we directly gave a workshop in “SHANGHAI STEAM FEST” from 
									Tongji University with 200 teachers from all around China. This is the first moment that I feel so happy that someone thought
									that doing something with a camera is very difficult, but they were very excited and appreciate so much after having 4 hours of workshop so 
									they could start to create a project with the computer vision technology.

                <p>Fablab O Shanghai at College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, coupled with Chinese Society of Education and China Adult Education Association hosted the From STEM To STEAM, the Structure and Mechanism of STEAM Education
					International Symposium - the Second FABO Annual Meeting  Oct. 29th - Nov. 3rd, 2019 in Shanghai. The goal for this event was to promote Fablabs at Universities and K12 schools in Mainland China under the global wave of maker movement and STEAM trends. This event was held in College of Design and Innovation, Tongji University, hosted by Jeff Ding of FablabO.  Fab Gurus Fiore Basile, Claudia Simonelli, Daniele Ingrassia,  Rico Kanthatham, Saverio Silliand and SCOPES-DF partner Sarah Wallace attended, giving talks and workshops over the week. </p>

                <p>At the beginning, I started to open some classes like making your own toy. At first, it actually went little bit difficult by I started to learn
					what kids want in this class. So I have more or less the same contents with FabAcademy but I always find a kids friendly softwares. Therefore, they
					could start design in 2D and 3D in just 2 classes. They were very excited especially went it comes to 3D Printer and laser cutter. It was very enjoyable
					to see how happy and excited learning and actually making something. I have never realised that actually kids could be better than adult. They were so currious around
					having fun with all the sensor and actuators that I have introduced it to them.

                <p>After just three months working in Shanghai, suddenly out of no where there is virus that made me had to come back to home, China was totally lockdown.
					Most of the border started to be closed including Indonesia. This is a difficult moment as a teacher to keep running the class. We lost the senses and 
					the facility in the labs. Luckily, I have started our own gitlab documentation but we always had problems that some students do not have VPN. They cannot 
					have "the real access" to the internet. It always blocked. So I decided to learn and actually install our own gitlab server in China. I have successfully
					implemented the FabOcloud.com, thanks to Fabacademy that gave me the inspiration. "Stand on the giant shoulder".

					After several months, the Chinese embassy still does not allow foreigners to enter China. The numbers of infected people keeps increasing drammatically. 
					Indonesia clearly had not noticed the dangerous of this Covid. I noticed the <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/">Prusa Face Shield</a>, so I decided to design one as well
					and at least to distribute it to unremote area in Indonesia because I have heard that one of the private hospital only used raincoat to cover themself. There is nothing lost to at least 
					try. We have successfully made 700 face shields.

					China went normal and Indonesia had the lockdown. I started to keep inovating and do what my student and I like to experiment.
