I am just not sastified how this world is becoming.
Life seems not fair for everyone, we most likely divided us into groups. People and me are selfish. 
We just do whatever, we think that has benefit from us.
Maybe this is the law, but if we are having fun helping others. We can make a huge different.

I want to do something big which the thing maybe I haven't figured it out or tell it to someone. It just seems to be stuck in my mind.
I am not a genius nor very good in speaking. I have a lot of weaknesses but it's not the things.
We could work together to make everything possible.

I release that if I can make a thing without a very good bussines plan, this is not going to work.
That is why a very good idea always lost because it is just not making enough profit to survive or sastify the bosses.
We are here not trying to save the world or being kind. At the end we are all human. I hope you understand what I meant.

sincerely,

My random thought.

° I would really empty my brain. This thought has been stucked and improved over time, writing this to someone might be helpful to release my thought.
I am depressed and also angry. I don't want to be over confident, it will make me stupid.
